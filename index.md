My research interests are focused on the design and development of machine learning algorithms, including .. 

> Deep neural networks - one of the sexiest models at our time, 

> Probabilistic models - uncertainties matter, 

> Quantum-inspired ML algorithms - preparation for the quantum computing era. 

These models have been applied in many areas such as bioinformatics, healthcare, natural language processing, and marketing.
