My research is focused on the design and development of machine learning algorithms which include .. 

> Deep neural networks - one of the sexiest models at our time, 

> Probabilistic models - simple yet effective methods, 

> Quantum-inspired algorithms - preparation for future. 

Our applications of those models focus on, but not limited to, bioinformatics, natural language processing, and marketing.
